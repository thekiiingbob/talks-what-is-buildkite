# Example Bash Script

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Note that we don't enable the 'e' option, which would cause the script to
# immediately exit if 'run_tests' failed
set -uo pipefail

# Run the main command we're most interested in
run_tests

# Capture the exit status
TESTS_EXIT_STATUS=$?

# Run additional commands
clean_up

# Exit with the status of the original command
exit $TESTS_EXIT_STATUS
```
